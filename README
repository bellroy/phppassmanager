IMPORTANT:
==========
In the accountview you have the possibility to copy the decrytped password to your clipboard.
If you use the firefox/mozilla browser you have to change your firefox security settings to use this feature.
Therefor add the fallowing line to your firefox/mozilla configfile (prefs.js). This file is located under your firefox user profile directory.
	user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true);
Another way is to change this setting directly over your browser interface.
Therefor call the URL "about:config", press the right button and insert a new boolean value
with name "signed.applets.codebase_principal_support" and the value "true".

It also make sense to protect the the phpPassManager pages with "htaccess" and use SSL to access the pages!
